# NetTron-Excel

## Skills used: Vlookup, Match, Index, and Sumif

### Description:
In this project, I use excel and real world data to create a quote for a network infrastructure project. The first page, Customer Quote, is an estimate of how much money each item in this infrastructure project would cost, the cost category of each item, and the overall cost of each installation location, along with the overall cost of the project.

The second page, International Price List, has a listing of each item needed, and its price point. I used vlookup to put each item in its own price category. The price categories are:
- A: $0 - $1,000 
- B: $1,000 - $10,000
- C: $10,000 - $25,000
- D: $25,000+

In the last page, Discount Matrix, I use an index function to calculate the customer's discount based on their customer category and discount category.
